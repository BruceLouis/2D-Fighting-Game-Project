Every sprite, every background, every sound effects implemented into this game is owned by Capcom. The music is Barbarians by Johannes Bornlöf
As of now this is a Street Fighter Clone. It’s a pure hobby project where I would implement my favorites from 2D fighting games. Right now there are 5 playable characters. 

A,S,D for punches, Z,X,C for kicks, A+Z for throws, arrows for directions and command inputs.
